# Monitoring Scripts

Some scripts I've built for monitoring purposes.

## Usage

These scripts return a value used by Icinga2 to present some status in IcingaWeb2 and save performance data into database. You can use these scripts with a monitoring tool or run manually for simple status return.

### Directory Size

Return the size of a directory in Linux. This is useful when there isn't quota implemented and you want to monitor the size.
